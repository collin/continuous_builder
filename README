Let's do builders :D

Class > ContinuousBuilder 

#(hey, why isn't that ruby syntax)

The a simple builder.

  class HamlBuilder < ContinuousBuilder
    builds Haml, 
      :files   => "#{FixtureRoot}/**/*.haml",
      :context => Object
  end

methods(:build) expects the first argument to be a Module.

This module should have an Engine class.

Engine::new should take a string argument representing the source.
Engine#render should take an optional Object to be the building context.

Great. There will be more as it's needed.
